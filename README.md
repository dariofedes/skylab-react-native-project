# SpaceX APP ðŸš€

This is a project to work with a React Native App.

**SpaceX APP** is an app that shows users which rockets are going to launch or land according to different dates or user's distance . ðŸš€ðŸš€

Futhermore, as it is created with different workspaces, we could always change the Platform, or Api and Theme without creating the App from its beginings.
